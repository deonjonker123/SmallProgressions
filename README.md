# Small Progressions

**Quality-of-life and progression mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 (NeoForge)**  
_Heavily inspired by Tiny Progressions_

## What This Mod Adds

### Automation

Growth Crystals speed up crops in a radius with three upgrade tiers. Cobblestone Generators produce cobblestone automatically across five tiers. Item Collectors pick up drops and dump them into chests—advanced version has filters and adjustable range. Lava Generators passively produce lava. Water Reservoirs give you infinite water in one block.

### Storage

Storage Barrels in four tiers (Copper/Iron/Gold/Diamond) with expanded capacity. Fluid Tanks hold large amounts of liquids across four tiers. Linen Sacks are portable storage that keeps contents when broken.

### Processing

Brick Furnaces smelt four times faster than vanilla furnaces.

### Progression

Four armor tiers: Steel, Emerald (jump boost), Dragon (flight + combat buffs), and Wither (powerful combat buffs). Matching tool sets for all tiers plus Paxels (pickaxe/axe/shovel combo) for every material including vanilla. Ender Ore lets you mine for ender pearls.

### Farming

New crops: blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, maloberries, cotton, and flax. Greenhouse Glass boosts growth in sunlight.

### Building

Colored Glowstone in all 16 colors plus glass variants. Asphalt blocks with stairs/slabs/walls. Reinforced Obsidian and Glass (explosion-proof, wither-proof). Marble, Slate, and Soul Sandstone with full variant sets. Thatch blocks. Hardened Stone variants. McFloaty Blocks let you place solid blocks in mid-air.

### Food

Expanded food options including pizza, bacon dishes, cooked eggs, special effect apples (Iron/Redstone/Emerald/Diamond grant temporary buffs), and berries.

### Utilities

Repair Totems passively fix items in your inventory. Lava Infused Stone acts as a permanent lava source. Sickle harvests straw from grass. Steel as a new material tier.
